	* cl-fun-mapping/clfm-unit-tests.lisp (assert-gmap2-equal, value):
	Pulled `value' into its own function.  The macro was complaining
	that the function was not defined when I had it under labels.

	* grid-operations/grid-iterating-functions.lisp
	(position-element): Filtered the mvector method for sbcl only

2011-02-15  Mirko Vukovic  <Mirko Vukovic <mirko.vukovic@us.tel.com>>

	* grid-operations/grid-io.lisp (read-csv-grid): Modified tests by
	explicitly specifying double float type on sbcl

	* grid-operations/grid-iterating-functions.lisp (position-element):
	Added methods that specialize separately on mvector and vector, so
	that I can opeate on CL's vectors in sbcl

	* cl-fun-mapping/clfm-unit-tests.lisp (assert-gmap2-equal, vecp):
	Pulled `vecp' as its own function instead of defined in `labels',
	since testing on sbcl involves mop, and makes the function a bit
	verbose.

	* grid-operations/grid-curry.lisp (?!-symbol-p): Copied function
	from my-utils to this file to break connection with my-utils.

	* grid-operations/make-grid-sequence.lisp (lseq, gseq): inserted
	explicit code for sequence creation instead of using calls to my
	own library

2011-02-14    <977315@WTEHDZYYN71>

	* grid-operations/grid-iterating-functions.lisp (grid-positions):
	New function.  Returns positions and values of all matches

2011-02-14    <977315@WTTCA1068>


	* grid-utilities-setup.lisp (#\#): #m read time macro now does
	nothing on clisp

	* cl-fun-mapping/clfm-generation-utilities.lisp (two-arg-gmap-ds)
	(one-arg-gmap-ds): Fixed tests to work on sbcl and clisp using the
	now disabled #m read macro on clisp

	* grid-operations/grid-io.lisp (read-grid): Fixed incorrect paths
	to test files that remianed after the directory reorg.  Also test
	file was in in correct directory and the csv one missing.  I
	recreated it.

	* grid-utilities-setup.lisp: Changed read-time-conditionalization
	from machine name to lisp type

2011-02-12    <977315@WTEHDZYYN71>

	* mv-grid-utils.asd (mv-grid-utils): Removed my-utils and
	mv-gnuplot prerequisites.  They were not needed.

	* cl-fun-mapping/clfm-by-example.lisp (sin%%%%%): Tuned
	destination specification to ffa for sbcl and cl for clisp

	* cl-fun-mapping/clfm-unit-tests.lisp (assert-gmap2-equal):
	Modified vecp to test for vector or mvector

	* cl-fun-mapping/clfm-generation-utilities.lisp,
	* cl-fun-mapping/clfm-by-example.lisp: Adding non-ffa and non-sbcl
	declarations: double-float -> float, for example


	* cl-fun-mapping/clfm-generation-utilities.lisp: unit tests could
	not compile on clisp because I was using #m reader macro.  I
	duplicated the tests for clisp and used the #( macro.  I choose
	between the tests using the #+ or #-clisp read-timme
	conditionalization facility.


2011-02-03  Mirko Vukovic  <Mirko Vukovic <mirko.vukovic@us.tel.com>>

	* mv-grid/mv-grid.asd (mv-grid): Renamed many files (but did not
	keep notes of it)

	* mv-grid/grid-function-declarations.lisp (fun/x/result-type):
	Modified list/symbol method to parse declarations such as 1+
	(*one-arg-functions*): Modified declarations such as 1+ by
	explicitly adding allowed argument types

2011-01-13  Mirko Vukovic  <Mirko Vukovic <mirko.vukovic@us.tel.com>>

	* mv-grid/grid-function-declarations.lisp (*one-arg-functions*)
	(*two-arg-functions*, *one&optional-second-arg-functions*):
	Changed format of function entries: the declarations are not
	grouped in a list anymore.  Now I use `rest' to access them all

2010-12-17  Mirko Vukovic  <Mirko Vukovic <mirko.vukovic@us.tel.com>>

	* mv-grid/grid-function-generators.lisp (*type-dictionary*): I
	changed my approach of using !F,I,C.  Prior to this, I wanted to
	use a symbol-macro to translate them.  However, the symbol macro
	substitution not work if I used a quoted list.  Instead I am using
	this a-list as a dictionary for both CL and grid types.

	* mv-grid/grid-utilities.lisp (intgen): Added integer generator.
	It generate grids of signed type.

2010-12-16  Mirko Vukovic  <Mirko Vukovic <mirko.vukovic@us.tel.com>>

	* mv-grid/grid-function-generators.lisp (*grid-fun-prefix*): Added
	(grid-fun-name): Modified to use *grid-fun-prefix*
	(add-grid-method): added
	(make-gf): added

	* mv-grid/mv-grid.asd: Implementation of the refactored mv-grid
	utilities package.

	* mv-grid/grid-utilities.lisp: Changed package to mv-grid.
	Cleanup of code as result of new package assignments

	* mv-grid/grid-utilities-unit-tests.lisp: Change of internal
	symbol references, because of change in package names and
	dependencies (it was part of mv-gsll that used gsll, and now it is
	part of mv-grid, which uses grid)

	* mv-grid/grid-functions.lisp: Changed package to mv-grid.
	Cleanup of code as result of new package assignments

	* mv-grid/grid-functions-unit-tests.lisp: Changed package to
	mv-grid.  Cleanup of code as result of new package assignments

	* mv-grid/grid-function-instantiations.lisp: Changed package to
	mv-grid.  Cleanup of code as result of new package assignments

	* mv-grid/grid-function-generators.lisp: Changed package to
	mv-grid.  Cleanup of code as result of new package assignments

	* mv-grid/grid-function-declarations.lisp: Changed package to
	mv-grid.  Cleanup of code as result of new package assignments

	* mv-grid/mv-grid-package-def.lisp (:mv-grid): Refactored code
	into mv-grid and mv-gsll packages.  Each lives in its own
	directory.

2010-12-08  Mirko Vukovic  <Mirko Vukovic <mirko.vukovic@us.tel.com>>

	* mv-grid/grid-utilities.lisp (gmap): Removed destination
	specification.  map-grid should rebuild it from the input grid.

	* grid-function-declarations.lisp (*one-arg-functions*): Changed
	signum's declaration to expect a complex-double-float.  This is
	the most general solution.  However, I think I should have two
	signums: grid-signum and grid-signum-complex to handle the various
	possiblities

	* grid-functions-unit-tests.lisp (:mv-gsll): Moved unit testing to
	the mv-gsll package, because I am using a lot of internal
	functions.  I need to change testing to internal and external.

2010-12-01  Mirko Vukovic  <Mirko Vukovic <mirko.vukovic@us.tel.com>>

	* grid-utilities.lisp (gmap): Modified gmap by adding code for
	:destination-specification
	(gsmap): New function for processing multiple gridS in parallel.
	It is the old gmap.

2010-11-15  Mirko Vukovic  <Mirko Vukovic <mirko.vukovic@us.tel.com>>

	* utilities.lisp: (lseq, xpseq, matrify): Commented out after
	update to latest gsll. I have to sort this out

2010-04-07  Mirko Vukovic  <mv@CYSSHD1>

	* utilities.lisp (reduce-0, reduce-1): added the function and
	their unit tests.

2010-03-23    <977315@WTEHDZYYN71>

	* 2nd-order-ode.lisp (setup-tridiag-11): Fixed sign error in the
	second derivative coefficients (all members that had DELTA^2.  But
	that begs the question, how did the unit tests pass?

2010-03-05  Mirko Vukovic  <mv@CYSSHD1>

	* mv-gsll.lisp (match-vec-element): Added match-vec-element
