Notes on unit tests:

I split unit tests between internal and external tests.  Internal
tests test the functioning of the package internals, and the external
tests test the external interface.


To do:

Allow grid mapping of cl math functions such as sqrt that
can emit a complex with a real argument (sqrt -1) and accept
a complex argument (sqrt #c(0 1)).
