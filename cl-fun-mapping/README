The file grid-generic-functions&methods-examples.lisp is the
documentation for this topic.

In particular the definition of functions sin% and log% and their
tests show this module's goals.

The rest of that file shows by example how this functionality was
implemented.

There may be remnants of other development branches in these files
that still need to be cleaned up.
