This directory still needs major cleanup as it is a result a merge of
several development paths.

The file grid-generic-functions&methods-examples.lisp is the
documentation for this topic.

In particular the definition of functions sin% and log% and their
tests show this module's goals.

The rest of that file shows by example how this functionality was
implemented.


Many files in this module have remnants of other development branches,
and still need to be cleaned up.
