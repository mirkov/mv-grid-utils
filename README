Utilites that work on grids generated by Liam Healy's GSD package.

Utility types:

 - functions for creating grids filled with linear, geometric,
   ... sequences
 - grid i/o (plain and csv files)
 - currying of functions of multiple arguments on one grid
 - misc grid manipulations
 - mapping functions on grids
 - grid iterating functions
 - cl math functions that operate on grids

Many of these utilities have counterparts in languages such as Matlab,
IDL ...

Design goals:

The calling and naming convention should follow CL, and not the above
mantioned languages.

Status:

The code is still in early development.  In particular the calling and
naming of functions is subject to change.

Testing:

I use lisp-unit and try to add in as many tests as possible.

Development platforms:

 - CLISP on cygwin & windows 
 - SBCL on linux

All unit tests pass on clisp.  On sbcl I get 48 assertions passed, 0
failed, 21 execution errors.
