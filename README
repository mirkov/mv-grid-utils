Utilites that work on grids generated by Liam Healy's GSD package.

WARNING: not production code.  Only inspect.  Depends on author's
internal libraries.

Utility types:

 - functions for creating grids filled with linear, geometric,
   ... sequences
 - grid i/o (plain and csv files)
 - currying of functions of multiple arguments on one grid
 - misc grid manipulations
 - mapping functions on grids
 - grid iterating functions
 - cl math functions that operate on grids

Many of these utilities have counterparts in languages such as Matlab,
IDL ...

Design goals:

The calling and naming convention should follow CL, and not the above
mantioned languages.

Status:

The code is still in early development.  In particular the calling and
naming of functions is subject to change.

As of 2011.02.12, the package is still dependent on some of my other
utilities and thus not suitable for external distribution.

Some of the unit tests that explicitly use the #m macros had to be
commented out, as I cannot use read-time-conditionalization to filter
clisp and sbcl relevant parts

Testing:

I use lisp-unit and try to add in as many tests as possible.

Development platforms:

 - CLISP on cygwin & windows 
 - SBCL on linux

All uncommented unit tests pass on clisp.

To do:

 - CLISP & SBCL branches are not fully merged yet.  Some tests
   developed on one platform fail on the other.
